    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="our-new-video-of-why-manifestly"&gt;Our New Video of 'Why Manifestly'&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've launched.  And, we have a video of the &lt;a href="https://manifest.ly"&gt;benefits of the Manifestly service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used &lt;a href="http://powtoon.com"&gt;PowToon&lt;/a&gt; to create the video.  We're impressed and found it very easy to use for this purpose.  We'll be using it for more 'explainer' type vides in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the new video we produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, not exactly the blog post we &lt;a href="/2014/01/20/live.html"&gt;wished&lt;/a&gt; we could write today, but little steps. Eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;a href="/2013/10/08/looking-for-ux-designer.html"&gt;still looking for a designer as a partner&lt;/a&gt; and meanwhile have managed to put together a reasonably functional UX.  With a solid designer though, we think the experience would be much, much better.  So, please share this link - it would help tremendously!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, we're very close to launching.  Very, very close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally&lt;/b&gt;!  &lt;a href="http://manifest.ly"&gt;We're live&lt;/a&gt;, but we're going to be quiet about things for just a bit.  Too much of the experience is not quite up to our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more weeks and we should be good to go with the MVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally&lt;/b&gt;.  The last few features and tightening of the application always take much longer than expected, but we feel like we're getting really close.  Our intern Zach has helped us implement a few things, and that's been great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still don't have a designer, so Philip has taken the reigns in order for us to go live. Although the design is not great, it'll need to be &lt;b&gt;good enough for the MVP&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All About Process Improvement</title>

&lt;p&gt;We've spent several months talking with organizations about what would interest them in a checklist app.  Anyone who's gone through this process knows how difficult this is because every organization has their own specific needs.  &lt;b&gt;Building something for everyone is a terrible mistake&lt;/b&gt; a startup can make, so figuring out the target of what are the core features for a core group of customers is indeed the million dollar question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="plan-do-check-act"&gt;Plan, Do, Check, Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, it's clear the most important aspect of checklists is that organizations use them as part of a &lt;b&gt;Process of Continuous Improvement&lt;/b&gt;.  Which is exactly the main theme from Atul Gawande's book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key's to process improvement is good process feedback.  The whole &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA"&gt;Plan, Do, Check, Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; cycle (W. Edwards Deming).  Checklists can be a great tool for gathering data as well as communicating process changes to those involved in the process.  And we're focused on enabling that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="looking-for-a-ux-designer"&gt;Looking for a UX Designer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, Mark and I are looking for a UX designer to join us.  Our partner in that work (Aaron) had to bow out due to his work and family obligations.  He is a great dude and designer and we were looking forward to his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we're a bit stuck as neither of us is good with design nor UX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're looking for someone who has interest in the vision of helping organizations improve.  Someone who is able to join as an &lt;b&gt;equity partner&lt;/b&gt; as this is a non-paying gig.&lt;/p&gt;
