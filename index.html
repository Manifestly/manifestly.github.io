<p>Ok, not exactly the blog post we <b>wished</b> we could write today, but little steps. Eh?</p>

<p>We are <a href="/2013/10/08/looking-for-ux-designer.html">still looking for a designer as a partner</a> and meanwhile have managed to put together a reasonably functional UX.  With a solid designer though, we think the experience would be much, much better.  So, please share this link - it would help tremendously!</p>

<p>And, we're very close to launching.  Very, very close.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2014/01/20/live.html">We're Live</a> <span>Jan 20</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h1 id="were-live">We're Live</h1>

<p><b>Finally</b>!  <a href="http://manifest.ly">We're live</a>, but we're going to be quiet about things for just a bit.  Too much of the experience is not quite up to our expectations.</p>

<p>A few more weeks and we should be good to go with the MVP.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2013/12/16/getting-close.html">We're Getting Close</a> <span>Dec 16</span></h2>

  <h1 id="were-getting-close">We're Getting Close</h1>

<p><b>Finally</b>.  The last few features and tightening of the application always take much longer than expected, but we feel like we're getting really close.  Our intern Zach has helped us implement a few things, and that's been great.</p>

<p>We still don't have a designer, so Philip has taken the reigns in order for us to go live. Although the design is not great, it'll need to be <b>good enough for the MVP</b>.</p>

<p>We've spent several months talking with organizations about what would interest them in a checklist app.  Anyone who's gone through this process knows how difficult this is because every organization has their own specific needs.  <b>Building something for everyone is a terrible mistake</b> a startup can make, so figuring out the target of what are the core features for a core group of customers is indeed the million dollar question.</p>

<p>And it's difficult.</p>

<h3 id="plan-do-check-act">Plan, Do, Check, Act</h3>

<p>With that said, it's clear the most important aspect of checklists is that organizations use them as part of a <b>Process of Continuous Improvement</b>.  Which is exactly the main theme from Atul Gawande's book.</p>

<p>One of the key's to process improvement is good process feedback.  The whole <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">Plan, Do, Check, Act</a></b> cycle (W. Edwards Deming).  Checklists can be a great tool for gathering data as well as communicating process changes to those involved in the process.  And we're focused on enabling that.</p>

  <h1 id="looking-for-a-ux-designer">Looking for a UX Designer</h1>

<p>Hey, Mark and I are looking for a UX designer to join us.  Our partner in that work (Aaron) had to bow out due to his work and family obligations.  He is a great dude and designer and we were looking forward to his work.</p>

<p>So now we're a bit stuck as neither of us is good with design nor UX.</p>

<p>We're looking for someone who has interest in the vision of helping organizations improve.  Someone who is able to join as an <b>equity partner</b> as this is a non-paying gig.</p>

  <h1 id="the-checklist-manifesto">The Checklist Manifesto</h1>

<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://m5rk.github.io">Mark</a> and <a href="http://wiscodude.github.io">I</a> read <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+checklist+manifesto">The Checklist Manifesto</a> and both of us searched around the internet for apps that help organizations <b>specifically</b> with checklists for organizations performing recurring processes.  We didn't find any.</p>

<p>Soâ€¦.we're building one.  And that's what we intend for <a href="http://manifest.ly">Manifestly</a>.</p>
