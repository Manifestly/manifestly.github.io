  <h1 id="can-checklists-help-baseball-teams">Can Checklists Help Baseball Teams?</h1>

<p>Well, Keith Law, <a href="http://search.espn.go.com/keith-law">Senior Baseball Writer at ESPN.com</a> thinks they might.</p>

<p>Keith is a <a href="http://meadowparty.com/blog/2014/06/11/the-checklist-manifesto/">big fan of checklists</a> and writes about them on his personal blog. He discovered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right-ebook/dp/B0030V0PEW">Checklist Manifesto</a> by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00555X8OA/">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> - another excellent book we recommend.</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A major league team might have a checklist to use before acquiring any player in trade, for example – looking at recent reports and game logs to make sure he’s not injured, talking to a former coach or teammate to ensure there’s no character issues, etc. A well-designed blank scouting report is itself a checklist, a way of organizating information to also force the scout to answer the most important questions on each player.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We agree! This could be part of an organization's more disciplined approach to data capture and analysis.  We've known for a long time that hiring (drafting) mistakes are very costly to any organization.  Anyone who has read or watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball">Moneyball</a> knows the importance of data in winning at the game of baseball.</p>

<p>You can read Keith's full article on <a href="http://meadowparty.com/blog/2014/06/11/the-checklist-manifesto/">checklists and baseball here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manifestly-assets/The-Roman-Candle-Logo.png" align="right" />
We've been working on the use of checklists in restaurants with <a href="http://theromancandle.com">The Roman Candle</a>. TRC has been using Manifestly on their admin checklists and they're very happy thus far.</p>

<p>There are many processes within restaurants that are golden opportunities for checklists, Daily Store Opening, Closing, Weekly reviews can all be better performed with a checklist software system like Manifestly.  We're excited to be working with TRC as they grow to more stores in Wisconsin and we congratulate them on their <a href="http://theromancandle.com/milwaukee/">new restaurant in Milwaukee</a>.</p>

<p>For any other restaurants, for a limited time we're offering our checklist service for free.  Forever.  Just contact us at <a href="mailto:support@manifest.ly">support@manifest.ly</a> to get started on using software to manage your <a href="https://www.manifest.ly">restaurant checklists</a>.</p>

  <h1 id="new-feature-scheduling-checklist-runs">New Feature: Scheduling Checklist Runs</h1>

<p>We have a new feature that allows you to schedule your checklist runs. This is great if you have checklists that recur on any kind of schedule, whether it is daily, weekly, monthly - any kind of schedule can be set.  3rd Thursday?  No problem.  Last day of the month?  You bet.  Every other Tuesday?  Yep!</p>

<p>We have a few companies using this feature and we're quite sure most customers will find value from this ability.</p>

<p>You can add a new <a href="https://www.manifest.ly/scheduled_runs">scheduled checklist</a> here if you are signed into your Manifestly account.</p>

<p>We've launched.  And, we have a video of the <a href="https://manifest.ly">benefits of the Manifestly service</a>.</p>

<p>We used <a href="http://powtoon.com">PowToon</a> to create the video.  We're impressed and found it very easy to use for this purpose.  We'll be using it for more 'explainer' type vides in the future.</p>

<p>Here's the new video we produced.</p>

<p>Ok, not exactly the blog post we <a href="/2014/01/20/live.html">wished</a> we could write today, but little steps. Eh?</p>

<p>We are <a href="/2013/10/08/looking-for-ux-designer.html">still looking for a designer as a partner</a> and meanwhile have managed to put together a reasonably functional UX.  With a solid designer though, we think the experience would be much, much better.  So, please share this link - it would help tremendously!</p>

<p>And, we're very close to launching.  Very, very close.</p>

  <h1 id="were-live">We're Live</h1>

<p><b>Finally</b>!  <a href="http://manifest.ly">We're live</a>, but we're going to be quiet about things for just a bit.  Too much of the experience is not quite up to our expectations.</p>

<p>A few more weeks and we should be good to go with the MVP.</p>

  <h1 id="were-getting-close">We're Getting Close</h1>

<p><b>Finally</b>.  The last few features and tightening of the application always take much longer than expected, but we feel like we're getting really close.  Our intern Zach has helped us implement a few things, and that's been great.</p>

<p>We still don't have a designer, so Philip has taken the reigns in order for us to go live. Although the design is not great, it'll need to be <b>good enough for the MVP</b>.</p>

  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h1 id="all-about-process-improvement">All About Process Improvement</h1>

<p>We've spent several months talking with organizations about what would interest them in a checklist app.  Anyone who's gone through this process knows how difficult this is because every organization has their own specific needs.  <b>Building something for everyone is a terrible mistake</b> a startup can make, so figuring out the target of what are the core features for a core group of customers is indeed the million dollar question.</p>

<p>And it's difficult.</p>

<h3 id="plan-do-check-act">Plan, Do, Check, Act</h3>

<p>With that said, it's clear the most important aspect of checklists is that organizations use them as part of a <b>Process of Continuous Improvement</b>.  Which is exactly the main theme from Atul Gawande's book.</p>

<p>One of the key's to process improvement is good process feedback.  The whole <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">Plan, Do, Check, Act</a></b> cycle (W. Edwards Deming).  Checklists can be a great tool for gathering data as well as communicating process changes to those involved in the process.  And we're focused on enabling that.</p>

<p>Hey, Mark and I are looking for a UX designer to join us.  Our partner in that work (Aaron) had to bow out due to his work and family obligations.  He is a great dude and designer and we were looking forward to his work.</p>

<p>So now we're a bit stuck as neither of us is good with design nor UX.</p>

<p>We're looking for someone who has interest in the vision of helping organizations improve.  Someone who is able to join as an <b>equity partner</b> as this is a non-paying gig.</p>

<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://m5rk.github.io">Mark</a> and <a href="http://wiscodude.github.io">I</a> read <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+checklist+manifesto">The Checklist Manifesto</a> and both of us searched around the internet for apps that help organizations <b>specifically</b> with checklists for organizations performing recurring processes.
