## What is a checklist?

We've written about this before, noting [the difference between checklists and
TODO lists](http://blog.manifest.ly/2014/09/22/difference-checklists-todo-lists.html).
The key difference is that the purpose of a checklist is to
highlight key decision points or risks that require communication and
collaboration among the team members using the checklist. A checklist tool--such
as [Manifestly](https://www.manifest.ly/)--enables such communication and
collaboration in real-time, and serves as a record of the decisions and
communication that took place.

> Pro Tip:  If your checklist enumerates every single step of the underlying
> process, you're probably doing it wrong. Imagine you have a store opening
> checklist for a restaurant. And one of the steps is, "Take the chairs off the
> tables and put them on the floor." It won't take long before the people using
> such a checklist every day completely checkout from using the checklist.

## What kinds of processes lend themselves best to the use of a checklist?

A checklist is all about highlighting key decision points, key checkpoints, key
risks, and facilitating communication and collaboration among the team
addressing these items. If you have a recurring process that involves no
decisions, no risks, and requires no communication--then it's probably not
a great candidate for the use of a checklist.

You may have many recurring processes in your organization. Which of these are
best suited for a checklist?

* How frequently do the people using the checklist perform the process?
* How much collaboration is involved in the process?
* How complex is the process? Are there important decision points? Are there
  real risks that need to be evaluated?

## What makes a checklist effective?

It flows pretty naturally from what we've already covered, that an effective
checklist is one that facilitates good decisions. Good decisions naturally flow
from good conversation. And what enables conversation better than good
questions?

> Pro Tip: If your checklist is full of questions, you're probably doing it right.
> Imagine a store opening checklist that ends with, “Would you invite your friends
> to join you to eat at this restaurant?”

## Summary

An effective checklist is first a checklist, not something else. Checklists are
best used with recurring processes that involve a team collaboratively making
decisions in the midst of complexity and risk. Good checklists tend to ask
questions, which is the easiest way to get the collaborative juices flowing.

In our next article, we'll looking at how you can take any checklist and improve
it over time.
