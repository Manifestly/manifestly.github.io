# Checklists and To-Do lists are different


<img align="right" width="200px" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/manifestly-assets/checklist.png" />
We talk with everyone we meet about checklists.  *Everyone*.  What we've
found is a common misunderstanding about the **subtle difference**
between checklists and to-do lists.

And if you're selling checklist software (like we are), the difference is important.


## Checklists are **How** To-Do
Checklists are best described as an agreement in an organization on **How to Do** specific (important)
processes. They are codified "best practices" about how these processes
*should* be done. Examples from our customers include a
**Daily Store Opening** checklist, **New Client** checklist,
 **Monthly Review** checklist, **Listing a Property** checklist and others.

## To-Do lists are **What** To-Do
To-do lists, on the other hand, are unique, ephemeral (thankfully!), and ad hoc
in nature.  They are your list (or your team's list) of **what** you need to get done (today, this week, etc).
There are tons of tools for managing to-dos.  We have used [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/),
[Any.do](http://www.any.do), and most recently we love [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com).

##  Instance of a Checklist (a run) is a To-do list
Here's where it gets interesting.  When you are **using** a checklist, that is
effectively a to-do list.  Got that?  The thing you refer to when you're building up
a list of steps you want everyone to perform - that is a checklist.  When they use it, they're using
the checklist, but it is acting like a to-do list since it is a list of **what** to do.

## Why does this matter?
It matters because checklists are an important part of **process improvement** activities.
By focusing on getting **the right things done the right
way** - the **How** - checklist are quality and consistency focused.

To-do lists don't provide this structure, nor do to-do list software solutions
focus on this continuous improvement process.  To-do lists focus on **getting
things done**, especially at the individual productivity level.

As always, if you haven't read [The Checklist Manifesto](https://gawande.com/the-checklist-manifesto),
we often have some [free Checklist Manifesto copies](https://www.manifest.ly/about)
to give away.
