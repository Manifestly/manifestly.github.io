We have a new feature that allows you to schedule your checklist runs. This is great if you have checklists that recur on any kind of schedule, whether it is daily, weekly, monthly - any kind of schedule can be set.  3rd Thursday?  No problem.  Last day of the month?  You bet.  Every other Tuesday?  Yep!

We have a few companies using this feature and we're quite sure most customers will find value from this ability.
