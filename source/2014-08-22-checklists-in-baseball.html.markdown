Well, Keith Law, <a href="http://search.espn.go.com/keith-law">Senior Baseball Writer at ESPN.com</a> thinks they might.

Keith is a <a href="http://meadowparty.com/blog/2014/06/11/the-checklist-manifesto/">big fan of checklists</a> and writes about them on his personal blog. He discovered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right-ebook/dp/B0030V0PEW">Checklist Manifesto</a> by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00555X8OA/">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> - another excellent book we recommend.

He says:

> A major league team might have a checklist to use before acquiring any player in trade, for example – looking at recent reports and game logs to make sure he’s not injured, talking to a former coach or teammate to ensure there’s no character issues, etc. A well-designed blank scouting report is itself a checklist, a way of organizating information to also force the scout to answer the most important questions on each player.

We agree! This could be part of an organization's more disciplined approach to data capture and analysis.  We've known for a long time that hiring (drafting) mistakes are very costly to any organization.  Anyone who has read or watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball">Moneyball</a> knows the importance of data in winning at the game of baseball.
