There are many processes within restaurants that are golden opportunities for checklists, Daily Store Opening, Closing, Weekly reviews can all be better performed with a checklist software system like Manifestly.  We're excited to be working with TRC as they grow to more stores in Wisconsin and we congratulate them on their <a href="http://theromancandle.com/milwaukee/">new restaurant in Milwaukee</a>.

For any other restaurants, for a limited time we're offering our checklist service for free.  Forever.  Just contact us at <a href="mailto:support@manifest.ly">support@manifest.ly</a> to get started on using software to manage your <a href="https://www.manifest.ly">restaurant checklists</a>.
