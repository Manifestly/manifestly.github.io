# Looking for a UX Designer

Hey, Mark and I are looking for a UX designer to join us.  Our partner in that work (Aaron) had to bow out due to his work and family obligations.  He is a great dude and designer and we were looking forward to his work.

So now we're a bit stuck as neither of us is good with design nor UX.

We're looking for someone who has interest in the vision of helping organizations improve.  Someone who is able to join as an <b>equity partner</b> as this is a non-paying gig.
