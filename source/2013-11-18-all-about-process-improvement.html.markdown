# All About Process Improvement

We've spent several months talking with organizations about what would interest them in a checklist app.  Anyone who's gone through this process knows how difficult this is because every organization has their own specific needs.  <b>Building something for everyone is a terrible mistake</b> a startup can make, so figuring out the target of what are the core features for a core group of customers is indeed the million dollar question.

And it's difficult.

### Plan, Do, Check, Act

With that said, it's clear the most important aspect of checklists is that organizations use them as part of a <b>Process of Continuous Improvement</b>.  Which is exactly the main theme from Atul Gawande's book.

One of the key's to process improvement is good process feedback.  The whole <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA">Plan, Do, Check, Act</a></b> cycle (W. Edwards Deming).  Checklists can be a great tool for gathering data as well as communicating process changes to those involved in the process.  And we're focused on enabling that.
